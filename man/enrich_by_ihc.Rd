\title{Enrichment Analysis Using IHC Expression Data}
\usage{
enrich_by_ihc(
  gene_list,
  ihc_reference,
  expression_levels = c("Medium", "High"),
  group_col = "Tissue",
  method = "hypergeometric",
  universe = NULL,
  gene_stats = NULL,
  n_perm = NULL,
  min_genes = 10,
  seed = NULL,
  alternative = "greater",
  expr_col = "Level"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_list}{Character vector of target genes (e.g., DEGs) to test for enrichment.}

\item{ihc_reference}{A data frame of IHC expression with columns for gene names,
expression level (e.g., "Not detected", "Low", "Medium", "High"),
and groupings such as cell type or tissue.}

\item{expression_levels}{Character vector indicating which IHC levels to treat as "expressed".
Defaults to \code{c("Medium", "High")}.}

\item{group_col}{Column in \code{ihc_reference} used for grouping (e.g., "CellType" or "Tissue").}

\item{universe}{Optional character vector of background genes. If NULL, all genes
found in \code{ihc_reference} are used.}

\item{seed}{seed for downstream gsea}

\item{...}{Reserved for future options.}
}
\value{
A data frame with enrichment statistics per group:
\itemize{
\item group (e.g. cell type)
\item p_value
\item overlap (genes shared with expressed set)
\item input_set_size
\item universe_size
\item leading_edge (string of overlapping genes)
}
}
\description{
Perform hypergeometric enrichment of a gene list across cell types or tissues
using categorical immunohistochemistry (IHC) data from the Human Protein Atlas.

# degs <- c("TP53", "BCL2", "CDKN1A")
